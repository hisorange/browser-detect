Easy to use package to identify the visitor's browser details and device type.
Magic is **not** involved the results are generated by multiple well tested and developed packages.
Supporting **every laravel** version between **4.0 &raquo; 6.5**, also tested on **every PHP** version between **5.6 &raquo; 7.3**.

### How to install

---

```sh
composer require hisorange/browser-detect
```

Yep, it's ready to be used by You! ^.^

### How to use

---

In Your code just call the **Browser** facade:

```php
use Browser;

// Determine the user's device type is simple as this:
Browser::isMobile();
Browser::isTablet();
Browser::isDesktop();

// Every wondered if it is a bot who loading Your page?
if (Browser::isBot()) {
    echo 'No need to wonder anymore!';
}

// Check for common vendors.
if (Browser::isFirefox() || Browser::isOpera()) {
    $response .= '<script src="firefox-fix.js"></script>';
}
```

Even in Your blade templates:

```blade
@mobile
    <p>This is the MOBILE template!</p>
    @include('your-mobile-template')
@endmobile

@tablet
    <p>This is the TABLET template!</p>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="tablet.css" title="Reduce the page size, load what the user need">
@endtablet

@desktop
    <p>This is the DESKTOP template!</p>
@enddesktop

{-- Every result key is supported --}
@browser('isBot')
    <p>Bots are identified too :)</p>
@endbrowser
```

Easy peasy, ain't it?

### Advanced Usage Information

---

The code is designed to be an easy to use style,
so every call You make on the **Browser** facade will access the result object and get the data for You,
but You can parse agents other then the current user's.

```php
// When You call the detect function You will get a result object, from the current user's agent.
$result = Browser::detect();

// If You wana get browser details from a user agent other then the current user call the parse function.
$result = Browser::parse('Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.0) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.14');
```

Worthy notion! The parser only parsing each user agent string once and then caches it,
it uses an inmemory runtime cache for multiple calls in a single page load;
And it will use the application's cache to persist the result for a week or so,
this should provide You with a sufficient caching mechanism so the detection will
cost less than **0.02 millisecond**, this was tested with a 80,000 fake visit.
